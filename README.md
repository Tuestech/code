### Testing setup

This is designed to be run in a Google Apps Script(GAS) web-app.

Copy all the files to the GAS project.
Note that all file names must be capitalized for the scriptlets to work.

When deploying, select web-app. Once deployed, you can use the versioned deployment or the test deployment.

We recommend using the test deployment when testing and debugging. Test deployments run from the most recently saved file, while versioned deployments will only run the files in the state that they were in when deployed.

### Pull requests

The title of a pull request should briefly describe your changes at a high level.
If you added a button in the dashboard, just put `Added a {what the button does} button to dashboard`

The description of a pull request should explain why something was added, removed, or changed.
This time, you can include any other information you think necessary.

If your pull request addresses an issue, be sure to provide a link to the issue in the pull request.

Sometimes, your pull request may not be up to our standards.
Don't worry, we will always explain what was wrong and how it can be fixed.
You can always submit another pull request
