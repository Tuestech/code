## New-contributors

If you've never used github or are new, that's fine. This README is designed to be beginner-friendly so anyone can contribute.

Don't worry too much about syntax, we will try to correct syntax on pull requests and issues.
Just make sure that you correct any issues we find.

&nbsp

## Reporting bugs

Navigate to the *Issues* tab at the top and create a new issue.

Make sure you put `[BUG]` at the beginning of your title.

Make a descriptive but concise title and write a brief couple sentences about a bug you found.
When you're done, just submit. 

After a bug is submited, you can track our progress and make sure everything is fixed.

&nbsp;

## Suggesting features

Navigate to the *Issues* tab at the top and create a new issue.

Make sure you put `[SUGGESTION]` at the beginning of your title.

Make a descriptive but concise title and write a brief couple sentences about your suggestion.
When you're done, just submit. 

After a suggestion is submited, you can track out progress and see your idea come to life!

### Testing setup

This is designed to be run in a Google Apps Script(GAS) web-app.

Copy all the files to the GAS project.
Note that all file names must be capitalized for the scriptlets to work.

When deploying, select web-app. Once deployed, you can use the versioned deployment or the test deployment.

We recommend using the test deployment when testing and debugging. Test deployments run from the most recently saved file, while versioned deployments will only run the files in the state that they were in when deployed.

### Using Github

If you're already familiar with Github, you can fork this repository and make a pull request with your changes.

If you want to contribute but don't know how to use Github, we can help! Follow the instructions below to get started.

**Step 1:** Fork this repository (Click `Fork` in the top right)

**Step 1.5:** If you already forked the repository, make sure your fork is up to date before coding by clicking `Fetch upstream`

**Step 2:** Make edits in your forked repo

**Step 3:** Make a pull request (Navigate to `Pull requests` and create a new pull request. Make sure it follows the 
[pull request guidelines](#Pull-requests)
.)

**Done!** Once your pull request is submited, we will handle the rest.

&nbsp;

### Pull requests

The title of a pull request should briefly describe your changes at a high level.
If you added a button in the dashboard, just put `Added a {what the button does} button to dashboard`

The description of a pull request should explain why something was added, removed, or changed.
This time, you can include any other information you think necessary.

If your pull request addresses an issue, be sure to provide a link to the issue in the pull request.

Sometimes, your pull request may not be up to our standards.
Don't worry, we will always explain what was wrong and how it can be fixed.
You can always submit another pull request
